This code does calculations and simulations under a model of density-dependent disease
with genotype-dependent mortality/recovery tradeoffs. It also simulates the evolutionary 
consequences of these epidemics by calculating changes in the fixation rate of deleterious
disease resitance alleles.

The code is wirtten in Python and can be installed by running:

python setup.py install --user

from the top directory. Simulation scripts are contained in the scripts directory. 

Remaking our figures:

Figure 1 is a concept figure, it contains a "real" simulation but is intended only
to illustrate our model.

Figure 2 does not contain any external data and can be remade with the scripts/Fig2.R

Figure 3 data can be remade by running scripts/makeFig3Data.sh from the top level directory
(./scripts/makeFig3Data.sh). The code for the figure is in Fig3.R

Figure 4 data can be remade by running scripts/makeTradeOffAlphas.sh and scripts/make.perS.sh from 
the top level directory. The code for the figure is in scripts/Fig4.R

Figure 5 data can be remade by running scripts/makeFig5Data.sh from the top level directory.
The code for the figure is in scripts/Fig5.R
